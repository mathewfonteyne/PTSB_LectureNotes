/* 
    ? Lookup Tables & State Machines

    * Lookup Table:
    - Objects that help us reference other values, great when working with collections of data.
    - Often called dictionaries, Objects work like dictionaries in JS, holding key value pairs to store collections of data.

    Lookup Table == Object/Dictionary

    These can help with/Why:
    - Make the code cleaner and easier to read.
    - Eliminated branching of conditionals by creating a simpler lookup.
    - Default evaluation does not need to wait for all conditions to get processed. If a key does not exist in the lookup table, it returns the default condition straightaway.
    - Good for evaluating multiple rules/two or more conditions.

// Create an arrow function named listGames with a parameter of system
const listGames = (system) => {
    // build a collection object
    let collection = {
        Nintendo: ["Duck Hunt", "The Legend of Zelda", "Super Mario Bros."],
        "Super Nintendo": ["Super Mario World", "F-Zero", "Star Fox"],
        Nintendo64: ["Super Mario 64", "Mario Kart 64", "GoldenEye 007"],
    };

    // console.log("Inside Function: ", collection["Nintendo64"]);

    return collection[system];
};

console.log(listGames("Nintendo64"));
console.log(listGames('Nintendo'));
console.log(listGames("Nope")); // Undefined if no match

// Another Example:

const stateAbbreviation = {
    alaska: "ak",
    delaware: "de",
    hawaii: "hi",
    indiana: "in",
    vermont: "vt",
};

const acronym = {
    asap: "as soon as possible",
    fomo: "fear of missing out",
    gif: "graphics interchange format",
    lol: "laugh out loud",
};

// console.log(stateAbbreviation['hawaii']);

// Create a findIt function that will use whatever object(dictionary) and key term(search) given and return the value result if found

function findIt(dict, search) {
    return dict[search];
}

let stateInUS = findIt(stateAbbreviation, "vermont");
console.log(stateInUS);

let acro = findIt(acronym, "gif");
console.log(acro);

// An example with else ifs (conditionals) versus table lookup:
// We have to take of a kiddo based on how they feel

// function howIsChild with parameter name of state that returns messages based on the kids status
const howIsChild = (state) => {
    if (state == "Hungry") {
        return "THE KID WANTS FOOD, WHERE's THE SNACKS!?!"
    } else if (state == "Sad") {
        return "The kiddo is crying, what do we do??"
    } else if (state == "Happy") {
        return "Aww they are laughing"
    } else {
        return "They're asleep."
    }
};

console.log(howIsChild("Happy"));
console.log(howIsChild());

// Use a table and arrow function to do the above:
const kidFeelsTable = {
    Hungry: "THE KID WANTS FOOD, WHERE'S THE SNACKS!?!",
    Sad: "The kiddo is crying, what do we do??",
    Happy: "Aww they are laughing"
}

const howIsKiddo = (state) => kidFeelsTable[state] || "They're sleeping...";
console.log(howIsKiddo("Happy"));
console.log(howIsKiddo());


/* 
    * State Machines:
    - A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.
    - A mathematical model of computation, usually used to design algorithms.

    State: is the set of all variables in a program and their values at any point in time.

    A simple example: A light switch.
    - The light switch has two states: on and off
    - Flipping the switch will transition to the other state 
    - When the "machine" exits the on state, we get a side effect of the light turning off.
    - When the "machine" enters the on state, we get a side effect of the light turning on.
    - https://statecharts.dev/on-off-state-machine.html

    A state machine is an alternative way of modeling program state: Instead of defining independent variables, a machine is crafted specifically to handle what states are possible, and when a machine is a given state, what next state is allowed.

// Build a traffic light state machine:

let state = {

    yield: ["red"]

let currentState = "green";

// Create a function to handle and transition between states
function enterState(newState) {
    // Create a check to see what values are valid and available

    // Establish which point in our state object that we want to reference
    let validTransitions = state[currentState];

    console.log(`\nThe light is currently: ${currentState}.`);

    // Check if our key includes the state the user wants to transition/change to.
