    - Part of HTTP structure in how we pass data (Will learn about in Unit 5 & 6)
- When a form is submitted, it automatically refreshes our browser.
        
## Some Attributes
- ```for``` helps tie labels with the input fields
- ```autocomplete``` allows us to show previous inputs that we might have had in past forms. Governs and depends on the browsers autocomplete feature.
- ```type``` notes what type of data to expect/we will receive
- ```name``` associates the name of the input (helps the label knw what input it is attached to)
- ```placeholder``` is a way for us to write a note to users as to what might be input/written into the input field. Helper/guide text.

    - This gets populated when a user types into it/interacts with it.
